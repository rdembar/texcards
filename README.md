# TexCards
TexCards was designed as a simple web app that allows you to create and study math flashcards using LaTeX. 

## Credits
TexCards uses a custom MVC framework built by me and based off of Curtis Parham's course "MVC PHP Framework" which can be found on YouTube. LaTeX equations are rendered using KaTeX, the documentation for which can be found at https://katex.org/. Illustrations are by Tatiana Smirnova and were used with a license from Vecteezy.
